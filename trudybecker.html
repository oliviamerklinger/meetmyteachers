     <h1>Professor Trudy Becker</h1>
     <h2>&star; INTERESTS &star;</h2>
     <p> Professor Trudy received her masters degrees in classics at UNC-CH and in history at Virginia Tech. Finishing her education she received her Ph.D. in classics from the University of Florida. She loves to teach because she gets to watch her students learn and love all of the topics she does specifically Rome. She has been doing study abroad for 21 years now in the summer in Italy. She has won a few teaching awards and advising awards at the college and university level. Professor Trudy has three children a set of twin boys and a daughter. Her sons both have a Ph.D. in applied math meanwhile, her daughter has a masters in publishing. She loves sports especially Boston teams and she has a passion for Rome.</p>
     <h2>&star; MY OPINION &star;</h2>
     <p>Personally history of any kind has never been one of my main interests or one of my strong suits. Professor Becker does a vey good job of teaching a class filled with hundreds of students as that can be a struggle. She provides powerpoints on her Canvas page which is very helpful as well as useful links related to the topic we have been discussing. I really like how the quizzes and tests are online so I can sit down at a convient time for myself and focus instead of being stressed out to know a certain amount of information at a specific time. This class discusses ancient topics hence the name of the class is Ancient History and has brought up some of the latin I have learned during highschool which was suprising and interesting.</p>
