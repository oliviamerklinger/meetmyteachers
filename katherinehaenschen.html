     <h1>Professor Katherine Haenschen</h1>
     <h2>&star; INTERESTS &star;</h2>
     <p>Professor Haenschen first started off her career by working with digital media. She has always been interested in research methods and how to generate knowledge so from her digital media job she became fascinated with how research on digital media can affect people. She became a professor at Virginia Tech and what she loves about research is that she can conduct her own research and be able to put her own name on it instead of someone else. Outside of her career she loves to cook with her husband and recently they have been cooking with this cookbook called <i>Smitten Eveyday</i> and her favorite recipe that they have baked so far are meatballs. She has never had a pet before since her dad is allergic to cats and now she lives in an apartment that would be too small to handle an animal. She loves to travel and she has visited over two dozen countries. Right after college she went backpacking across Europe, Asia, South America. She loved to be able to speak a different language and to try new foods. </p>
     <h2> &star; MY OPINION &star;</h2>
     <p> Personally, I think this class has been the hardest one this semester however, I find the information that we have learned very interesting. I have learned about qualitative and quantitative research as well as hypothesis and statistical testing. Specifically for example how to conduct field observations, interviews, surveys, content analysis, focus groups, and much more. What helped myself a bunch although at the time was a burden to complete would be her in class activites. This would help me learn much better because it allowed me to apply the knowledge from what I had just learned in class that day to the task at hand. Also during class we weren't allowed to have our phones or computers so we were forced to write our notes by hand which actually really helped myself learn and stay focused. I think Professor Haenschen can be pretty strict however, overall she is a very good teacher that not only teaches you the information but also shows you how to apply what you are learning to your career and your future.</p>
