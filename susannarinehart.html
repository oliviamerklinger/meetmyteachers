     <h1>Professor Susanna Rinehart</h1>
     <h2>&star; INTERESTS &star;</h2>
     <p> Professor Rinehart received her masters degree from UNC Chapel Hill in a professional actors training program. She loves teaching Intro to Theatre because she gets to connect with students from all different majors and she especially loves if someone ends up switching their major to theatre because of her class. She enjoys having a large leture class and likes how theatre unlike other subjects is about human experience. With her little time outside of work and theatre she loves to cook. This is why she is looking forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas because she has the opportunity to cook her favorite dishes that she has been making since she was a child. She also really enjoys doing pilates. She used to have three cats when she moved to Blacksburg however, after they lived a long life they all have passed away. They are now buried in her backyard and they each have their own "kitty stone" to represent their burial. </p>
     <h2>&star; MY OPINION &star;</h2>
     <p> Personally, I needed to take a class that covered one of my requirements so I decided to take the class Introduction to Theatre. This class is definitely not one of my favorites however, as time has gone on I have found an appreciation for theatre and the information Professor Rinehart has taught myself. I read all the plays that she has assigned to read as well as attended both of the plays that the Virginia Tech theatre group has performed. A few of my favorite readings from this semester would definitely have to be <i>The Proof</i> by David Auburn and <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> by Lorraine Hansberry. I enjoy this class because Professor Rinehart is so passionate about theatre and her job which makes the class more interesting to listen to. I think it's great that a requirement of the class is to attend two of the plays that Virginia Tech performs because it supports the school as well as the actors and actresses that put effort and time into the play.</p>
