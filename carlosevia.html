     <h1>Professor Carlos Evia</h1>
     <h2>&star; INTERESTS &star;</h2>
     <p> Professor Evia completed his education at Texas Tech University recieving his Ph.D. in technical communication and rhetoric. He loves communication design and he thinks presentation is very important this is why he enjoys teaching visual media. If you have an idea but have no way of conveying that message then it's not important; presentation is important. He loves all types of music so he doesn't really have a favorite however, if he had to choose one he enjoys old school hip hop and R&B. His favorite animal is a monkey and although he doesn't have any pets of his own his wife owns a dog named Amos. He has a young daughter named Sophia and she is obsessed with Disney princesses so he spends much of his time hanging out with her and watching Disney princess movies.</p>
     <h2>&star; MY OPINION &star;</h2>
     <p> Personally, I really enjoy Professor Evia's class on Visual Media. I have learned so many important aspects that help me with my major such as how to use programs from the Adobe Creative Cloud including InDesign and Phtotoshop. I have also learned special techniques when taking photos to make a picture look a certain way. To conclude the class we are learning how to code and create a website which is the point of this project and is what I have created for you all as you're reading this website at the moment. I have an internship this summer with a real estate company and I will be handling their social media sites and creating brochures and other advertisments and without the help from this class this internship wouldn't be possible. Professor Evia is very fun, laidback, and is very easy to talk to. He is always willing answer all of your questions and help you with assignments. Everything that I have learned this semseter in this class will help me in the future and my overall opinion of this class is that you learn very useful knowledge and it's exciting.</p>
