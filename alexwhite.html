     <h1>Professor Alex White</h1>
     <h2>&star; INTERESTS &star;</h2>
     <p> Professor White received his bachelor degree from Virginia Tech leading into himself earning his masters degree from Ohio State and ending his education with a Ph.D. at Virginia Tech in agricultural economics. He loves teaching personal finance because it is useful information that everyone needs to know no matter what age or major you have. He has no pets because he travels too much however, he wants a dog specifically a border collie. He loves any type of woodworking especially making small furniture and things of that sort. He is not a hunter however, he enjoys target shooting. Professor White mostly goes by the nickname Doc White in class and he loves to start the day off with a Youtube video to get the mind working in the early hours of the morning.</p>
     <h2> &star; MY OPINION &star;</h2>
     <p> Personally, I have never liked anything related to math hence my major as Public Relations doesn't have much to do with math at all however, this class is different. Personal finance teaches you life lessons that relates to math that you will eventually have to deal with at some point in your life because everyone does. For example, I have learned about taxes and how to fill out all of the different forms, various types of loans and insurance, investments, and much more. I think that every student should be required to take this class because it provides basic knowledge that everyone should know how to do. Professor White puts all of his Powerpoint slides on Canvas which is very helpful when completing assignments and studying in case I missed something while taking notes. Professor White is a very sweet man and always goes above an beyond for his students to be able to fully understand the material. If they want to learn more he provides extra information and websites students can access, overall this class is very important and Professor White does an amazing job at teaching his students.</p>
