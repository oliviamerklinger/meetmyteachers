     <h1>Meet My Virginia Tech Teachers From Fall 2018!</h1>
     <p> Hello! My name is Olivia Merklinger and I am a sophomore at Virginia Tech this year. I am a Public Relations major within the Communications Department and I'm also completing a minor in business leadership. During this semester I am taking two classes that pertain specifically to my major, Visual Media and Communication Research. The three other classes I am taking pertain to the Curriculum for Liberal Education also known as CLE's. I have to obtain a certain amount of hours of classes outside of my major that cover all of the areas required so I have chosen Personal Finance, Theatre, and Ancient History. The purpose of this website is to inform you all about my teachers from the classes I am enrolled in this fall semester of 2018. I will be telling you who is teaching the class, what the professors interests are inside and outside of the class, and my opinion about the class. I hope you gain some knowledge about the different subjects I am taking this year and learn a little bit about my professors.</p>
